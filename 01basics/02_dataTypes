/*  What are Data Types?

Data types in programming are like categories that tell the computer what kind of data you're working with.

JavaScript has several built-in data types, which can be categorized as follows:

- String: Used for textual data and enclosed in single or double quotes.

- Number: Represents numeric values, including integers and floating-point numbers.

- Boolean: Represents true or false values, often used in conditional statements.

- Undefined: "Undefined" means a variable exists but has no value;

- Null: "null" means it's intentionally empty, like an empty box.

- Object: A collection of key-value pairs, allowing you to create complex data structures.

- Array: An ordered list of values, accessible by their index.

* Working with Data Types in JavaScript:

• Concatenate Strings: Use the (+)operator to combine strings, like adding names to greetings.

let greeting = "Hello,"; 
let name = "Aina"; 
let message = greeting + name; // Results in "Hello, Aina"

• Mathematical Operations: Perform calculations with numbers, such as addition or subtraction.

These tools allow you to handle different types of data, manipulate text and numbers, make choices based on conditions, and manage missing or empty data.
